# JS30-Prac

There is JS practice repository. 
I will try to implement practices example suggested during the courses of [#JavaScript30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP6CGK4YVJhL_VWetA865GOH) by Wes Bos 


**Example Practices :**

1. Make a JavaScript Drum Kit in Vanilla JS! ( _1_drumKit_ )
    - _note :_ sounds are not proper for example 
2. We build a CSS + JS Clock in Vanilla JS! ( _2_clock_ )
